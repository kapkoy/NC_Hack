# NC_Hack

Just add this folder to your .nuke folder, and add this line to you init.py
```nuke.pluginAddPath("./NC_Hack")```

At first launch, it will install opencv-python, then you'll be able to use the NC_RENDER node to render exrs up to 5760x3240 in non-commercial.
Just try and keep it non-commercial, this is for my pure enjoyment and learning purpose.

if you want a less expensive way to use a commercial license, maybe you are eligible for indie:
