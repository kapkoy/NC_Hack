# NC_Hack

all SHEEP words replace the "you know what" word. Just replace it everytime you see it

Just add this folder to your .SHEEP folder, and add this line to you init.py
```SHEEP.pluginAddPath("./NC_Hack")```

At first launch, it will install opencv-python, then you'll be able to use the NC_RENDER node to render exrs up to 5760x3240 in non commercial

Don't sue me ;)
